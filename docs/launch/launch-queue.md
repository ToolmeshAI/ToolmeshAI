# Launch Queue

This file turns the current launch kit into an execution queue for manual posting or future automation handoff.

Status snapshot: April 15, 2026

- Current browser sessions are not logged into `X`, `Hacker News`, or `V2EX`.
- `Reddit` is currently blocked by a prove-human gate in the active browser session.
- Use this file as the control document once accounts are available.

## Platform Status / 平台状态

| Platform | Current status | Direct URL | First target | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| X | Blocked until login | https://x.com/compose/post | `mcp-saas-foundry` | Log in, post from [x.md](/home/knox/workspace/github_work/ToolmeshAI/docs/launch/x.md), then queue follow-ups. |
| Hacker News | Blocked until login | https://news.ycombinator.com/submit | `mcp-saas-foundry` | Log in, submit the flagship repo first, then wait before any second HN launch. |
| Reddit | Blocked by prove-human gate in current session | https://www.reddit.com/submit | `mcp-saas-foundry` | Retry in a clean logged-in browser profile, or wait until the gate clears, then submit to one relevant subreddit at a time. |
| V2EX | Blocked until login | https://www.v2ex.com/new | `mcp-saas-foundry` | Log in, post the Chinese long-form version, and choose the most relevant node manually. |
| Juejin | Available if account is ready | https://juejin.cn/editor/drafts/new/v2 | `mcp-saas-foundry` | Use the Chinese long-form framing from [zh-communities.md](/home/knox/workspace/github_work/ToolmeshAI/docs/launch/zh-communities.md). |
| Chinese groups | Manual only | No universal composer URL | Portfolio summary | Use the long-form Chinese post or short repo blurbs in Telegram, Discord, or WeChat groups. |

Direct prefill patterns where supported:

- Hacker News: `https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=<repo-url>&t=<title>`
- Reddit: `https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=<repo-url>&title=<title>`

## Recommended Posting Order / 建议发帖顺序

Use one flagship repo at a time. The current priority should stay:

1. `mcp-saas-foundry`
2. `safe-mcp-config`
3. `docs-to-context`
4. `ToolmeshAI` portfolio/org post
5. `awesome-mcp-workflows`
6. `browser-agent-recipes`

Execution sequence:

1. Launch `mcp-saas-foundry` on `Hacker News` first if the account is available.
2. Post the matching `X` version the same day or the next day.
3. Use `Reddit` once the prove-human gate is cleared.
4. Push the Chinese long-form version to `V2EX` or `Juejin`.
5. Move to `safe-mcp-config` only after the flagship repo has had time to collect traffic.
6. Move to `docs-to-context` after `safe-mcp-config`.
7. Use the `ToolmeshAI` portfolio thread and Chinese long post to cross-link the rest of the portfolio.
8. Keep `awesome-mcp-workflows` and `browser-agent-recipes` as secondary links unless a platform-specific conversation clearly fits them.

Practical spacing:

- Do not stack multiple `Hacker News` launches close together.
- Prefer one primary repo post per platform per day.
- Use comments, replies, and follow-up posts to mention secondary repos instead of opening with them.

## Per-Platform Queue

### X

- Composer: https://x.com/compose/post
- Copy source: [x.md](/home/knox/workspace/github_work/ToolmeshAI/docs/launch/x.md)
- Posting order:
  1. `mcp-saas-foundry`
  2. `safe-mcp-config`
  3. `docs-to-context`
  4. `ToolmeshAI` portfolio thread
- Next action:
  Log in, paste the matching copy, attach one repo hero asset if available, and keep each post focused on one repo.

### Hacker News

- Submit: https://news.ycombinator.com/submit
- Prefill pattern: `https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=<repo-url>&t=<title>`
- Copy source: [hacker-news.md](/home/knox/workspace/github_work/ToolmeshAI/docs/launch/hacker-news.md)
- Posting order:
  1. `Show HN: mcp-saas-foundry – a forkable starter blueprint for SaaS-focused MCP servers`
  2. `Show HN: safe-mcp-config – scan MCP configs for risky patterns before sharing them`
  3. `Show HN: docs-to-context – bundle scattered docs into one Markdown context file for coding agents`
- Next action:
  Log in, submit only `mcp-saas-foundry` first, and hold the other two until there is enough time between launches.

### Reddit

- Submit: https://www.reddit.com/submit
- Prefill pattern: `https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=<repo-url>&title=<title>`
- Copy source: [reddit.md](/home/knox/workspace/github_work/ToolmeshAI/docs/launch/reddit.md)
- Suggested communities:
  `r/mcp`, `r/LocalLLaMA`, `r/programming`, `r/node`, plus niche communities that allow self-promo
- Next action:
  Clear the prove-human gate first. Then submit one repo per subreddit, starting with `mcp-saas-foundry`.

### V2EX

- New topic: https://www.v2ex.com/new
- Copy source: [zh-communities.md](/home/knox/workspace/github_work/ToolmeshAI/docs/launch/zh-communities.md)
- First target:
  `mcp-saas-foundry`, then the 3-repo long post if the node allows broader sharing
- Next action:
  Log in, choose the right node manually, and lead with the practical SaaS starter angle rather than the whole portfolio at once.

### Juejin

- Editor: https://juejin.cn/editor/drafts/new/v2
- Copy source: [zh-communities.md](/home/knox/workspace/github_work/ToolmeshAI/docs/launch/zh-communities.md)
- First target:
  the 3-repo long-form summary
- Next action:
  Turn the long post into a more explanatory article, then add direct repo links near the top.
